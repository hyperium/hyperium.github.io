You want to contribute? You're awesome!

Contributions come in all shapes and sizes. Let's take a tour of some of the different wants you could contribute.

## [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)

Firstly, all interactions with the project need to abide by the code of conduct. This is to make sure everyone is treated kindly.

## [Issues](issues.md)

- **Filing an issue** is a contribution. We appreciate you letting us know about bugs you've found, and any information that you can provide that we can use to make hyper better. Without your filing it, we may not be aware of the bug.
- [Triaging issues](issues.md#triaging) is a huge help. By your helping make issues better, the reporters can get answers sooner, and others can fix them with less effort. You can also volunteer as a frequent [triager](maintainers.md#triagers).
- Discuss [feature requests][feat] (especially those marked [request-for-comment][b-rfc]).

[feat]: https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AC-feature
[b-rfc]: https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AB-rfc


## [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md)

By the way, consider checking the [list of easy issues](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-easy) if you want to submit something.

- [Submitting a Pull Request](pull-requests.md#submitting-a-pull-request)
- [Commit Guidelines](commits.md)

## Documentation

Improving hyper's documentation is a huge help for everyone who is trying to _use_ hyper.

- The API documentation (rendered at https://docs.rs/hyper) is stored as rustdoc comments directly in the source.
- The main website has [tutorial-style guides](https://hyper.rs/guides). As of v1, they are currently in a [revamp](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/3411), and would greatly benefit from being filled out.

## Help

Helping others use hyper in their specific workflows is a very valuable way to contribute.

- Answer questions asked directly in hyper's [Discussions](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/discussions).
- Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kkwpueZ) and help those who show up with questions.
- **Blog about hyper.** You writing a blog post about how you use hyper to do something specific, or how you contributed a new feature, or debugged something in it, is a great idea. Not all examples can fit in the hyper repo. Search engines will help people find their use cases on your blog. And you can describe processes in more depth or from a different perspective.
