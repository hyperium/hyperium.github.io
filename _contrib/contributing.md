## Cargo fmt

`cargo fmt --all` does not work in hyper. Please use the following commands:

```txt
# Mac or Linux
rustfmt --check --edition 2018 $(git ls-files '*.rs')

# Powershell
Get-ChildItem . -Filter "*.rs" -Recurse | foreach { rustfmt --check --edition 2018 $_.FullName }
```

> **NOTE**: If you are using `rust-analyzer`, you can add the following two lines in your `settings.json` to make sure the features get taken into account when checking the project:
>
>    ```json
>     "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": ["full"],
>     "rust-analyzer.check.features": ["full"],
>    ```
