We'd like to welcome Adam Foltzer ([@acfoltzer](https://github.com/acfoltzer)) as a hyper Collaborator. He has done some great work improving edge-case HTTP/1 support, planning, and most importantly, brings a kind attitude. For instance:

- [Ignore obs-text in HTTP/1 reason phrases](https://github.com/seanmonstar/httparse/pull/84)
- [Refactor the httparse benchmarks to better identify performance changes](https://github.com/seanmonstar/httparse/pull/112)
- [Allow multiple spaces in request and status lines](https://github.com/seanmonstar/httparse/pull/110)
- [Add hyper extension to access `ReasonPhrase`](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2792)

Thanks for all you do for us, we're excited to have you aboard!
