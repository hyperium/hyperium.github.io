We're thrilled to welcome katelyn martin ([@cratelyn](https://github.com/cratelyn)) as a hyper Collaborator. katelyn first contributed back in 2020, and more recently has been improving various utilities and documentation. Some highlights:

- [Adding new `hyper-util` additive IO adapters](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper-util/pull/170)
- Kind reviews that are based on hyper's VISION.

Thank you for helping the project and ecosystem!
