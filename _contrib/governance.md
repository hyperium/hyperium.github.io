# Governance

## Making decisions

There's two main pieces to the way decisions are made in hyper:

1. A decision-making framework
2. The people who apply it

The people are described [lower down in this document](#roles).

### Decision-making framework

We start with the users. The project wouldn't exist without them, and it exists
in order to enable users to do amazing things with HTTP. We listen to our
users. Some actively contribute their thoughts, but many others we must seek
out to learn about their usage, joys, and headaches. Those insights allow our
experts to determine the best solutions for the users.

We then define a set of [TENETS](./TENETS.md), which are guiding principles
that can be used to measure aspects of individual decisions. It should be
possible to identify one or more tenets that apply to why a decision is made.
And the set helps us balance which priorities are more important for our users.

We combine the usecases with the tenets to come up with a [VISION](./VISION.md)
that provides a longer-term plan of what hyper _should_ look like.

Finally, we define a [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md) that describes what the
short-term, tactical changes to bring hyper closer in line with the vision.

## Roles

These are the roles people can fill when participating in the project. A list
of the people in each role is available in [MAINTAINERS](./MAINTAINERS.md).

### Contributor

A contributor is anyone who contributes their time to provide value for the
project. This could be in the form of code, documentation, filing issues,
discussing designs, or helping others on the issue tracker or in chat.

All contributors MUST follow the [Code of Conduct][coc].

house-keeping duties, help lead the direction, and have the final authority when
required.
