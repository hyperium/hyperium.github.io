          <h3>Open</h3>
          <p>hyper is open source, always. The success of hyper depends on the health of the community building and using it. All contributions are in the open.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
          <h3>Correct</h3>
          <p>hyper is a memory safe and robust implementation of the HTTP specification. It is durable to the “real world”. Where feasible, hyper enforces correct usage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
          <h3>Fast</h3>
          <p>A fast experience delights users. A faster network library means a faster application, resulting in delighting our users’ users. Whether with one request, or millions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
          <h3>HTTP/*</h3>
          <p>hyper is specifically focused on HTTP. Support for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2, with HTTP/3 in the works.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
          <h3>Flexible</h3>
          <p>hyper enables as many usecases as possible. It has no opinion on application structure, and makes few assumptions about its environment. This includes being portable to different operating systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
          <h3>Understandable</h3>
          <p>hyper is no more complicated than it has to be. HTTP is not simple. It may not be as “easy” as 1-line to do everything, but it shouldn’t be “hard” to find the answers.</p>
