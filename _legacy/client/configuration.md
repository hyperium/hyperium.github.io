## Using TLS

By default, a [`Client`][] can only speak to HTTP addresses. This is because hyper doesn't
ship with a TLS implementation. You may have noticed that `Client::new()` returns a 
`Client<HttpConnector>`. We can plug in a different connector using the client config.

Since connecting to HTTPS addresses is so common, hyper provides a separate [hyper-tls][]
crate with a pluggable `HttpsConnector`. Here's how you'd use it.

```rust
# extern crate hyper;
# extern crate hyper_tls;
#
use hyper::Client;
use hyper_tls::HttpsConnector;

# fn run() {
let https = HttpsConnector::new();
let client = Client::builder()
    .build::<_, hyper::Body>(https);
# }
# fn main() {}
```

## Connectors

As mentioned in the section about TLS, [`Client`][] is generic over a connector.

You can plug in any kind of connector you need. This means that you could pick a
different TLS implementation than the one chosen by `hyper-tls`, such as `rustls`.
You could also have a completely different way of creating IO objects. Here's some
ideas of things that could be connectors:

- Unix sockets
- Proxies
- In-memory streams (such as for testing)
